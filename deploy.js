========== MrLister Deployment Ready ==========

Your MrLister application is ready for deployment.

To deploy the application:
1. Use the "server-esm.js" file for ES Module-based deployment
2. Or use "simple-server.cjs" for CommonJS-based deployment

Both server files include:
- Basic HTTP server functionality
- CORS support for cross-origin requests
- WebSocket server on /ws path
- API health endpoint on /api/health

For best deployment results:
- Make sure all required NPM packages are installed
- Ensure the necessary environment variables are set
- Configure the deployment to use Node.js 18 or higher

Example deployment command:
$ node server-esm.js
